### Hi there! I'm Kenichycmd and I make random projects!
## About me! [So you can know me better]
So basically, I'm a 14 year old dude who just likes to code anything. Why did I decide to code instead of being a cool school kid? No idea! All I know about myself is I can use a computer and type stuff on it! I know Java, C++, HTML, and MySql. My favorite operating system is Debian thank you very much ╮(#ˇωˇ)╭.
