### Hi there! I'm Kenichycmd and I make random projects!
## About me
So basically, I'm a 13 year old dude who just likes to code anything. Why did I decide to code instead of being a cool school kid? No idea! All I know about myself is I can use a computer and type stuff on it! I know ([1/2] Java), ([1/2] C++), ([1/4] HTML), and ([1/4] MySql). My favorite operating system is Ubuntu thank you very much ╮(#ˇωˇ)╭.

Projects I'm working on:
- ConfigPing
  - 6/17/2020 Started the project.
  - 7/23/2020 Renamed the project.
- ~DiscordPresences~
  - 8/14/2020 Started the project.
  - 8/27/2020 Cancelled the project.
