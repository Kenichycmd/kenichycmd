### Hi there! I'm Kenichycmd and I make random projects!
## About me! [So you can know me better]
So basically, I'm a 13 year old dude who just likes to code anything. Why did I decide to code instead of being a cool school kid? No idea! All I know about myself is I can use a computer and type stuff on it! I know Java, C++, HTML, and MySql. My favorite operating system is Ubuntu thank you very much ╮(#ˇωˇ)╭.

Projects I'm working on:
  
  | Project Name        | Project Status                | Project Type | Project Changelog |
  | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
  | ConfigPing          | 7/23/2020 Renamed Project     | Java         | No Website Yet    |
  | ~DiscordPresences~  | 8/27/2020 Cancelled Project   | C#           | No Website Yet    |
 
 Operating System I'm currently using:
 - Ubuntu 20.04 (Main)
 - Windows 10 (Secondary)
 
## About my website! [To learn about my website]

#### My website is mainly based off my custom API and random projects I make.

The website wont be running so you might just have to wait a bit.

If you would like to use my custom API visit https://api.kn-1.net/

Max API uses is 200. Might increase later on.

If you don't know how to use my API, its alright! You can still use it without any cURL / PHP knowledge! Just use https://tools.kn-1.net/

I will be adding more to the About my website page and yeah thats about it for this section. https://kn-1.net/
